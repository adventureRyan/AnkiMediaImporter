AnkiMediaImporter
============

Anki add-on for importing media files as new notes.

[Link to add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/129299120)

This add-on is an updated version of the [Media Import](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1531997860) add-on, which is no longer being maintained.

---

This add-on allows you to import media files into your Anki collection and use their file or folder names as a component of the note. You can create cards that might look like this (using `apple.jpg`):

When the add-on is installed, a `Media Import 2...` option will be added to the `Tools` menu.

Selecting this menu item will open the Media Import 2 window.

![Dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Iksas/media-import-2/master/docs/dialog.png)

From this window, you are able to:

- Browse and select which folder to use as the source of media files
  - Subfolders will be imported as well if the "Include subfolders" checkbox is activated
- Choose which note type to use for the imported notes
- Decide what content to put into each of the fields

Here is a list of the content available to insert into fields (with an example file located at `./f1/f2/apple.JPG`):

- **Media** - The media file itself (image or audio will appear on the card)
- **File Name** - The name of the file without the extension (`apple`)
- **File Name (full)** - The name of the file including the extension (`apple.JPG`)
- **Extension** - Only the lower-case extension of the file (`jpg`)
- **Extension (case-sensitive)** - Only the original extension of the file (`JPG`)
- **Sequence** - A number indicating the order in which the file was imported. If 15 files were imported, each file will contain a value starting from 0 to 14. Always starts over from 0 for each import.
- **Subfolder tags (individual)** - Creates separate tags for each subfolder (`f1` and `f2`). If this option is used in a non-tag field, the names are combined with spaces (`t1 t2`). Requires the "Include subfolders" checkbox to be active.
- **Subfolder tag (hierarchical)** - Creates a single, hierarchical tag for the subfolder hierarchy (`t1::t2`). Requires the "Include subfolders" checkbox to be active.

All new generated cards are added to a deck named `MediaImport`. This deck is created for you automatically if it doesn't exist.
